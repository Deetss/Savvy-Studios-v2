Uses Active Admin for managing galleries and contact requests.

# Add this later
## Development
## Peculiarity X

Add a section for each special concept in the application, e.g. a CDN and what
it is used for, that icons are rendered from a custom icon font and how to update
it, that all posts are created from an importer, that there's a web UI *and* a
JSON API *and* an embeddable component.

Make the reader aware of a peculiarity, but remember to keep it short. Details
should be documented in the respective area.
